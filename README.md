Painting
========
This is one of my unoptimized solutions to the Code Golf puzzle posted at
http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/22144/images-with-all-colors.

The example output, `example.png`, is a 4096x4096 image containing exactly one
pixel of every possible 24-bit color. An image with the same constraints may be
randomly generated by running the command `python draw.py -x 4096 -y 4096`
(though this may take some time).


Technical Notes
===============
To run draw.py, it is assumed that you have the PIL package properly
installed. If the resulting image does not properly display on Windows Vista
or Windows 7, please modify your ImageShow.py PIL source code as described in
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7715501/pil-image-show-doesnt-work-on-windows-7.
